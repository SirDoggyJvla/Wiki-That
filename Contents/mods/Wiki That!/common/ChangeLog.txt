1.5.0
Added:
- Moodles support: right click a moodle on the HUD to open a context menu to access wiki pages of moodles
- Ability to right click traits in the in-game character menu

Updated:
- Pages dictionary (page indexes, new pages, moved pages etc.)
- Complete reorganization of the files. This means old files will still be present in your installation, but I support it by making those old files empty. In the future, I will remove those old files completely, going with the supposition that everyone updated to the new version. Preferably, do a fresh install of the mod.
- Improved context menu system to use a custom context menu class, should make it easier to render fresh custom context menus

Fixed:
- Tile and crop text in the Wiki That tooltip
- Removed cache system for WikiElement as it was causing issues and was not really needed

1.5.1
Fixed:
- Files moved from 42 to 42.12 folder, thus old extra files I had left as a safeguard for users are now fully ignored. (thanks to albion's suggestion)
