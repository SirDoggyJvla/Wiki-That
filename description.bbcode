Wiki That! is a mod which provides tools to quickly access wiki pages related to various aspects of Project Zomboid, directly from in-game. It adds context menu options to items, fluids, vehicles, and other game elements.

Direct support for [url=https://pzwiki.net]pzwiki.net[/url] links is present in the game, thus increasing the Wiki pages access from inside the game.
